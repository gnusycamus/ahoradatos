Q: Do GeForce 4MX cards run GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas?
A: Though they are technically poorer than the minimum spec quoted for the game (GeForce 3), the game does run with these, though they are very slow and as a result not recommended.

Q: The minimum graphic card spec is quoted as a 64 meg GeForce 3 or better. Does this mean my 32 meg video card won't work?
A: We don't specifically lock out cards that have less memory than 64 megabytes BUT they are not recommended as they are only able to run in the 640*480 resolution and will be un-acceptably slow.

Q: When I attempt to launch GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas my computer reboots?
A: Disabling the AUTO REBOOT option from System Properties > Advanced > Startup and Recovery will allow the generated Windows blue screen error to be viewed. Mostly these blue screens will probably show hardware problems or driver problems.
A: Try lowering the Sound Acceleration setting from Full to Standard.

Q: Can I use HDTV modes?
A: With patch 1.01 we have added support for the following HDTV modes :- 720p + 1080i. Please note this support depends upon setting these modes correctly via your video drivers AND the selected display correctly supporting these modes.

Q: Will overclocking my graphics card make a difference to GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas?
A: GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas can and does stress different parts of a GPU to "normal" PC games. We have noticed machines which will overheat while running GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas that do not overheat with other games. As a consequence we do not recommend overclocking with this title. Often results of overheating in GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas can be seen as 3d models having spikes caused by vertices becoming corrupted, reboots and VPU recovery errors on ATI video cards.

Q: My Nforce motherboard based computer (with a Realtek based on-board sound chip) keeps re-booting and / or crashing with a blue screen?

A: It may be that your DVD-ROM device requires a firmware update. Check if the manufacturers have updated the firmware and if so is it documented to cure security incompatabilities.
A: Your DVD-ROM could be incompatible with the security system we use. Browse to the directory that you installed GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas into, and right click on the gta-sa.exe file and select ANALYSIS.

Q: I have a joypad connected, however I don't see any joypad buttons listed when I go into the Controller setup screens?
A: The first time you go to the controller setup screen, if you do not have a joypad connected, then the game sets itself up to not use a joypad. If you subsequently go back to these screens with a joypad connected you should reset the controls to default and you will find the default joypad controls have been applied.

Q: When I start GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas there is a black screen with some music playing behind it before I get to the intro scene with CJ in the Airport?
A: These are the Rockstar logo movies and the game intro movie playing back with no video being output. We have found that this is a symptom of using older Nvidia video drivers - we observed this with 67.02, and found it cured when we upgraded to 71.89.

Q: Roads in the mid distance have a very noticeable black shadowed look that clears up as I get closer.
A: Try making sure you are not forcing Bi-Linear or Tri-Linear filtering to ON in your video drivers. Set MipMapping in GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas Display Options to OFF. Use Anistropic Filtering for the best look in game (you will need to force this ON in your video drivers control panel). Increasing the screen resolution will also push this distance further out.

Q: I cannot aim using the right mouse button and / or when I get in the car and drive the camera constantly rotates around the car?
A: Make sure that you do not have another analogue device attached which also provides mouse emulation. Examples of this would be analogue joysticks, remote controls etc.

Q: I start the game in the highest resolution that the game offers to me. When I get into game I find some of the screen is not drawn, and the part that is drawn suffers from heavy ghosting / double images?
A: This will be the game using a scrollable resolution. When you set your desktop to this same resolution you will find that pushing your mouse pointer to the edges of the screen will cause it to scroll to allow you to see the full extent of the desktop. You will find that by installing the correct monitor INF file that you can properly enable supported resolutions for your graphics card.

Q: On the mission Fender Ketchup, the game will not progress past the opening cutscene where the garage door opens and shuts too quickly. I have the frame limiter switched off on my <really fast> PC?.
A: If you find a cutscene not progressing like this, enabling the frame limiter will allow the timing in the cutscene to work correctly and allow you to progress past this point.

Q: I input some cheats to GRAND THEFT AUTO: San Andreas and then saved over the top of the one save file I have been using. Now when I load up this save it crashes instantly and / or acts weird.
A: Saving while cheats are enabled is not supported. Do not save after inputing cheats to the game.
